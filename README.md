Created a player.js ,enemy.js , rock.js and ship.s file to abstract player ,enemy , rock and ship modules.

Added a player.png and rock.png to represent the player and rock sprites respectively

Created an update function for the player and enemy prototype. I make the enemy rotate per frame , and make the player move by user input.

I was also created an update fuction for the ship prototype. The ship follows the mouse click.

I tried to make collision between the ship and the rock and a collision between the player and the enemies.
It should work but it doesn't. I printed out the value returned by overlap , and it returns false. I am not quite sure why,
